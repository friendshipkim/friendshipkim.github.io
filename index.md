Hello!
I am currently a research intern at Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST). I am a member of [KIST Data Science Team](https://kdst.tistory.com/). My research interests lie in the broad field of machine learning and natural language processing and machine learning. Before joining KIST, I received a B.A. in Applied Statistics and a B.S. in Computer Science from Yonsei University.
